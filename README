skid: stupid-simple unit testing for PHP

Usage is stupid simple: drop skid into a directory and `skid path/to/test_file.php` from console.
skid will instantiate the class with the same name as the file (class `test_file` in our example here)
and execute any public methods beginning with `test`.

**TODO**

 - Run tests on a directory (`skid .`)
 - Exception handling in tests
 - Isolating assert calls (mostly for point above)
 - Code coverage?
 - etc.
